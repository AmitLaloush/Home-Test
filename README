About:
This project fetching and displaying all wrold countries from this api "https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/"
you can sort the countries by name(ascending/descendin) and by area(ascending/descendin)
when clicking on a country the app will display a list of all the countries with a boarder to the selcted country

In the test description there wasn't anything about database so i didn't integrate the database in the project, 
but if i did, whenever i fetch a country from the api i will insert it to the db and in the next time the user will fetch a country i will first check if it exists in the database
